# Digital Literacy Narrative Version 1 (DLN): Begining the journey into the world of Digital Humanities (Word Count: 520 Words)

As an 17-year-old university computer science student studying digital humanities, I have come to appreciate the importance of digital literacy in our world. Digital literacy is not just about knowing how to use digital technologies, but also about understanding how they affect our daily lives and how we can use them to create and share content, interact with others, and analyze data.

In my daily life, I rely heavily on digital technologies to stay connected with my friends and family, as well as to stay up-to-date with current events and trends. I use social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram to follow people and topics that interest me and to share my own thoughts and experiences with others. I also use messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram to communicate with friends and classmates in real-time.

When it comes to content creation, I use a variety of tools and platforms to express my creativity and share my ideas with others. For example, I use Adobe Creative Cloud to edit photos and videos, and I use WordPress to create and publish my own blog posts. I also use Google Docs and Slides to collaborate with classmates on group projects and presentations. In my academic life, I use a range of software and tools to analyze data and create visualizations. For example, I use R programming language to manipulate and analyze data, and I use Tableau to create interactive data visualizations. I also use various digital archives and databases to conduct research on historical events and figures.

Despite my proficiency in using these digital technologies, I am always looking for ways to improve my digital literacy skills. In my digital humanities course, I am learning how to critically evaluate digital media and the impact it has on society. I am also learning how to create digital projects that are accessible and inclusive to all users.

One thing I would like to improve is my understanding of cybersecurity and data privacy. With the increasing prevalence of cyber threats and data breaches, it is important for individuals to take proactive measures to protect their personal information online. I would like to learn more about best practices for creating strong passwords, avoiding phishing scams, and using encryption tools to protect sensitive information. Another area of improvement for me is in the realm of digital storytelling. I have learned that digital storytelling is not just about using fancy tools and techniques to create visually appealing content, but also about crafting a compelling narrative that engages the audience and conveys a message or idea. I would like to learn more about how to create effective digital stories that communicate a message and evoke emotions in the audience.

Overall, I believe that digital literacy is a vital skill for everyone to have in today's world.
