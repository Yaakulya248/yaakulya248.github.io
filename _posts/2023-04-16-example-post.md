## What is Corpus? 
A corpus is a large and structured collection of written or spoken texts that are used for linguistic analysis and research. The texts in a corpus can come from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, magazines, speeches, conversations, or any other form of written or spoken communication.
Corpora are used for a variety of purposes in linguistics and natural language processing, such as developing language models, studying language variation and change, identifying patterns in language use, and evaluating the performance of language technologies.
For example, the British National Corpus (BNC) is a corpus of modern British English that contains over 100 million words from a variety of sources, including newspapers, magazines, academic journals, and spoken conversations. Linguists and natural language processing researchers can use the BNC to study various aspects of the English language, such as vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and discourse. Another example is the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA), which is a corpus of American English that contains over 560 million words from various sources, such as fiction, newspapers, academic texts, and spoken conversations.


# Why is Corpus helpful? 

Corpus is helpful because it is a large and organized collection of texts or spoken language that is used for linguistic analysis and research. Here are some reasons why corpus is useful:
Language analysis: Corpus provides a wealth of linguistic data that can be used to study different aspects of language such as grammar, vocabulary, syntax, and discourse. Linguists can analyze the frequency, collocation, and distribution of words and phrases in different contexts, and identify patterns and trends in language usage.
Language learning: Corpus can be used as a resource for language learners to improve their vocabulary, grammar, and writing skills. Learners can study authentic texts in context and learn how words and phrases are used in different situations.
Machine learning: Corpus is a valuable resource for developing natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and training machine learning models. By analyzing patterns in the language data, these algorithms can be used to automate tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.
Discourse analysis: Corpus can be used to analyze different types of discourse such as academic texts, legal documents, and social media posts. By analyzing the language used in these contexts, researchers can gain insights into the social and cultural factors that influence language use.
Overall, corpus is a valuable resource for linguistics research, language learning, and machine learning applications. It provides a rich source of language data that can be analyzed and used to gain insights into the structure, usage, and meaning of language.



#  Metadata about the chosen Texts

For our upcoming assignment, my groupmate Yaakulya and I have selected three of Arthur Conan Doyle's gripping crime novels to delve into. These captivating works include "My Friend the Murderer," "A Study in Scarlet," and "The Mystery of Cloomber."

Arthur Conan Doyle, a distinguished British writer and physician, made his mark on literature with his outstanding detective and crime novels. Along with practicing medicine, he was an accomplished writer of short stories. However, he skyrocketed to fame after creating one of the most beloved fictional characters of all time, the brilliant detective Sherlock Holmes.
In our quest to analyze and explore these three intriguing novels, we examined the plot, character development, language usage, and thematic elements present in Conan Doyle's writing. These texts are sure to provide us with a riveting journey into the realm of crime and mystery, and we eagerly anticipate delving into the works of this iconic author.
