# Uncovering Insights from Corpus Data through Utilization of Accessible Analytical Tools

## What is Corpus? 

A corpus is a large and structured collection of written or spoken texts that are used for linguistic analysis and research. The texts in a corpus can come from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, magazines, speeches, conversations, or any other form of written or spoken communication.

Corpora are used for a variety of purposes in linguistics and natural language processing, such as developing language models, studying language variation and change, identifying patterns in language use, and evaluating the performance of language technologies. For example, the British National Corpus (BNC) is a corpus of modern British English that contains over 100 million words from a variety of sources, including newspapers, magazines, academic journals, and spoken conversations. Linguists and natural language processing researchers can use the BNC to study various aspects of the English language, such as vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and discourse. Another example is the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA), which is a corpus of American English that contains over 560 million words from various sources, such as fiction, newspapers, academic texts, and spoken conversations.

# Why is Corpus helpful? 

Corpus is helpful because it is a large and organized collection of texts or spoken language that is used for linguistic analysis and research. Here are some reasons why corpus is useful:


1) Language analysis: Corpus provides a wealth of linguistic data that can be used to study different aspects of language such as grammar, vocabulary, syntax, and discourse. Linguists can analyze the frequency, collocation, and distribution of words and phrases in different contexts, and identify patterns and trends in language usage.
2) Language learning: Corpus can be used as a resource for language learners to improve their vocabulary, grammar, and writing skills. Learners can study authentic texts in context and learn how words and phrases are used in different situations.


3) Machine learning: Corpus is a valuable resource for developing natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and training machine learning models. By analyzing patterns in the language data, these algorithms can be used to automate tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

4) Discourse analysis: Corpus can be used to analyze different types of discourse such as academic texts, legal documents, and social media posts. By analyzing the language used in these contexts, researchers can gain insights into the social and cultural factors that influence language use.


Overall, corpus is a valuable resource for linguistics research, language learning, and machine learning applications. It provides a rich source of language data that can be analyzed and used to gain insights into the structure, usage, and meaning of language.


# Metadata about the chosen Texts

For this upcoming assignment, my groupmate Yaakulya and I have selected three of Arthur Conan Doyle's gripping crime novels to delve into. These captivating works include "My Friend the Murderer," "A Study in Scarlet," and "The Mystery of Cloomber."

Arthur Conan Doyle, a distinguished British writer and physician, made his mark on literature with his outstanding detective and crime novels. Along with practicing medicine, he was an accomplished writer of short stories. However, he skyrocketed to fame after creating one of the most beloved fictional characters of all time, the brilliant detective Sherlock Holmes.

In our quest to analyze and explore these three intriguing novels, we examined the plot, character development, language usage, and thematic elements present in Conan Doyle's writing. These texts are sure to provide us with a riveting journey into the realm of crime and mystery, and we eagerly anticipate delving into the works of this iconic author.

| Book    | Genre      |  Date         |  Notes        |
| :---        |    :----:   |         :---: |          ---: |
| My friend the murderer| Detective       | 1887         | Short stories|
| A study of the scarlet     | Detective | 1887       | Sherlock Holmes series|
| The Mystery of Cloomber      | Mystery| 1888          | Fictional novel|

# Tools Used: 

To conduct a thorough analysis of these captivating crime novels, my groupmate Yaakulya and I turned to cutting-edge digital tools. Specifically, we utilized the Voyant tool to delve deeper into the intricate layers of Arthur Conan Doyle's writing.
The Voyant tool provided us with a dynamic platform for exploring the novels' various elements, including word usage, frequency, and patterns. With this innovative software, we were able to identify key themes and motifs that permeated throughout the texts, gaining invaluable insights into Conan Doyle's writing style.


<img src="/assets/wordcloud.png" style="width:80%; height:50%; margin-left:10%;" />

Word Cloud of all the three books combined. 

Given Scale: 135 
Highest repeated word : said (830), #1: 207 counts, #2: 443 counts, #3: 108 counts 
Smallest repeated word : thereâ€™s (64), #1: 13 counts, #2: 52 counts, #3: 0 Counts


In our initial analysis, we examined all three novels concurrently using the powerful Voyant tool, which enabled us to identify general themes and trends within the texts. Our focus was on the top 135 words that appeared repeatedly across all three works, and one word stood out in particular: "said." This ubiquitous word was used a total of 830 times throughout the three novels, with "My Friend the Murderer," "A Study of the Scarlet," and "The Mystery of Cloomber" featuring it 207, 443, and 180 times, respectively.

The prevalence of the word *"said"* may suggest that these crime novels are rich in dialogue, a common characteristic of the mystery and detective fiction genres. In such genres, dialogue is often used as a tool to reveal crucial information and advance the plot. As the novels are works of fiction, the author must naturally create a diverse range of characters and conversations for them, thus leading to the frequent repetition of the word "said" in order to establish who is speaking and move the dialogue forward.

Another surprising word that emerged as one of the most frequently repeated in all three novels was *"man,"* appearing a total of 509 times, making it the second most repeated word overall. One possible reason for this frequent use of the word *"man"* could be the genre of the books themselves. As works of mystery and detective fiction, the novels likely feature numerous unknown characters or suspects, and the word *"man"* may have been used as a generic term to refer to these individuals. This also suggests that the majority of the characters in these novels were likely male, as the word "man" is typically gendered.
Moreover, given that these novels are from the nineteenth century, when female detectives were not yet common, the overuse of the word "man" is not surprising. The author's use of this term may reflect the prevailing attitudes and assumptions of the time, where men were viewed as the primary actors and decision-makers in society, and women were relegated to supporting roles. Overall, the word "man" serves as a powerful reminder of the historical context and social dynamics that shaped the writing of these renowned crime novels.

## Analytical Data of all the three books included.

Aside from the specific words such as "man" and "said," we also found that the most common words in each of the texts were the names of the main characters, the locations where the events took place, and certain cultural, regional, or religious indicators that provide context to the story.

For instance, in "The Mystery of Cloomber," words such as "Singh," "Buddhist," "corporal," and "general" suggest that this novel has some connection to India and military affairs. This gives us a sense of the cultural and historical background of the story and helps us to understand the context in which the events unfold. By examining the most commonly used words in each of these novels, we can gain insight into the themes, settings, and characters that the author wanted to emphasize, and deepen our understanding of the rich and complex worlds that Arthur Conan Doyle created in his crime fiction.

# Individual Analysis of the Sub Corpus

## Analytical data from the Book 1: My friend The Murderer

<img src="/assets/image5.png" style="width:80%; height:50%; margin-left:10%;" />

This analysis revealed that the word "said" was prominently repeated in the middle sections of the book, specifically segments 4 to 6. This suggests that these parts were primarily dialogue-driven, whereas other sections were more focused on descriptive sentences. The concentration of the word "said" in the middle segments indicates that the characters were engaged in conversations, making those parts more dynamic and engaging for the reader.

## Analytical data from the Book 2: A Study In Scarlet

<img src="/assets/image7.png" style="width:80%; height:50%; margin-left:10%;" />

Here, it is evident from the analysis that the term "Gutenberg" was exclusively used in the first and last segments of the book. This indicates that the term was not used in the actual content of the book, despite being among the most frequently used words in the book's text format. Since the text version of the book was obtained from Project Gutenberg, it is likely that the term "Gutenberg" was mentioned in the metadata section located at the beginning and the end of the book.
