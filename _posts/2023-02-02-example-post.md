#Assignment 2 Title

## Brief Intro about Metadata. 

Metadata refers to the information that describes other data. It is essentially data about data, and it can provide valuable insights into the content, context, and structure of information. Metadata is important because it helps to organize, manage, and preserve information. It makes it easier to search for and retrieve information, and it can also provide valuable insights into patterns and relationships within data. For example, metadata can be used to track the usage of digital resources, such as website traffic or downloads of digital files. It can also be used to ensure that information is properly preserved and archived over time, by documenting its history and provenance.

Metadata plays a critical role in many different fields, including information science, library science, and digital humanities. It is especially important in the era of big data, where massive amounts of information are generated and stored every day. Without metadata, it would be nearly impossible to organize and make sense of all this information. Overall, metadata is a crucial component of information management and organization. By providing valuable insights into the content, context, and structure of data, metadata helps to make information more accessible, useful, and meaningful.
