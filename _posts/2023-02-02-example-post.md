## Brief Intro about Metadata. 

Metadata refers to the information that describes other data. It is essentially data about data, and it can provide valuable insights into the content, context, and structure of information. Metadata is important because it helps to organize, manage, and preserve information. It makes it easier to search for and retrieve information, and it can also provide valuable insights into patterns and relationships within data. For example, metadata can be used to track the usage of digital resources, such as website traffic or downloads of digital files. It can also be used to ensure that information is properly preserved and archived over time, by documenting its history and provenance.

Metadata plays a critical role in many different fields, including information science, library science, and digital humanities. It is especially important in the era of big data, where massive amounts of information are generated and stored every day. Without metadata, it would be nearly impossible to organize and make sense of all this information. Overall, metadata is a crucial component of information management and organization. By providing valuable insights into the content, context, and structure of data, metadata helps to make information more accessible, useful, and meaningful.

## Painings and Metadata 

So here I used Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME) to extract the metadata of two similar images of Shah Jahan sitting on a Throne.

Before talking more about paiting, we need to discuss more about DLME. 

## Brief about DLME Library: 
DLME stands for "Digital Library of the Middle East." It is a collaborative project between various institutions and organizations, including the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), the Antiquities Coalition, and several universities and libraries. The DLME is a digital library that aims to provide open access to cultural heritage materials from the Middle East and North Africa region, including manuscripts, maps, photographs, and other materials. The DLME also provides metadata and other information about the materials in the collection, as well as search and discovery tools to help users explore the materials. The DLME is designed to preserve and promote the cultural heritage of the region, while also making it accessible to researchers, scholars, and the general public. The advantages and disadvantages of this library are as follows: 

**Advabtages**

1) Accessibility: The DLME provides easy access to a wealth of cultural heritage materials from the Middle East and North Africa region. This makes it easier for researchers and scholars to access primary sources and conduct research remotely, regardless of their physical location.

2) Preservation: The DLME is dedicated to preserving and digitizing rare and fragile materials, such as manuscripts, photographs, and maps. By creating digital copies of these materials, the DLME helps to protect them from deterioration and damage.

3) Collaboration: The DLME is a collaborative effort between various institutions and organizations, including museums, libraries, and archives. This collaborative approach allows for a wider range of materials to be included in the digital library, and it also helps to promote cross-institutional research and collaboration.

4) Education: The DLME provides educational resources and tools to help students and educators learn about the cultural heritage of the Middle East and North Africa. These resources can be used to supplement classroom learning and provide students with access to primary sources and historical materials.

5) Research: The DLME provides a valuable resource for researchers and scholars interested in the history, culture, and languages of the Middle East and North Africa. The digital library includes a wide range of materials, including manuscripts, photographs, maps, and audiovisual materials, which can be used to conduct research in a variety of fields.

**Disadvantages:**
1) Limited scope: The DLME currently focuses on materials from the Middle East and North Africa region, which may limit its relevance and usefulness to researchers and scholars in other parts of the world.

2) Language barriers: Many of the materials in the DLME are in non-English languages, such as Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. This may make it difficult for researchers and scholars who do not have proficiency in these languages to access and use the materials effectively.

3) Digitization challenges: Digitizing rare and fragile materials, such as manuscripts and photographs, can be a challenging and time-consuming process. There is also a risk of damage or loss during the digitization process, which could result in the loss of valuable cultural heritage materials.

4) Funding and sustainability: The DLME is a collaborative effort between various institutions and organizations, and its long-term sustainability may be affected by changes in funding or institutional priorities. This could result in the discontinuation of the project or a reduction in the scope and quality of its materials.

5) Copyright and ownership issues: Many of the materials in the DLME are subject to copyright and ownership restrictions, which may limit their use and dissemination. Researchers and scholars may need to obtain permissions and licenses to use the materials, which could be a barrier to access and use.

## The Painting: 

About this painting: The Peacock Throne was a magnificent throne made for the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century. The throne was adorned with precious gems and covered in gold, and it was said to be one of the most opulent objects ever created.

The Peacock Throne was commissioned by Shah Jahan, who ruled the Mughal Empire from 1628 to 1658. Shah Jahan was a patron of the arts and architecture, and he is best known for commissioning the construction of the Taj Mahal in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. He was also a great patron of the decorative arts, and he commissioned many works of art, including the Peacock Throne. The painting depicting Shah Jahan on the Peacock Throne is a 19th-century work of art. It shows the emperor sitting on the throne, which is covered in gold and precious stones. The back of the throne is decorated with peacock feathers, hence the name "Peacock Throne." In the painting, Shah Jahan is depicted wearing richly embroidered clothing and jewels, with a halo around his head to symbolize his divine status.

The Peacock Throne itself was lost in history and is no longer in existence, but its legacy lives on through the many works of art and literature that have been created about it over the centuries. The Peacock Throne was a symbol of the wealth and power of the Mughal Empire, and it remains a fascinating and intriguing object to this day.

**Findings:** If we closely peek into both the painting we can clearly understand that both the painting looks similar, but not the same! For eg, look at the cusion color and the turban shades of Shah Jahan. The fasinating point is they both were punblished under the same title: Shah Jahan on the Peacock Throne. But both the painting have seperate sub parameters followed by the main title. For instance, painting 1 has (Private) - Image Title: 24469516 and painting 2 has (MET, 13.228.53), Image Title: Detail 17198905 which clearly represented that both the paintings are from the same source which is Harvard University Library, specifically at Fine Arts Library, Harvard University.

Although the paintings are similar, the parameters used in the subject of both the paintings are different, Painting 1 have [miniatures (paintings), portraits, thrones
borders (ornamental areas), illuminations, kings and rulers, haloes, flowers, iris (plant), poppies, birds] and the Painting 2 have [Islamic art, portraits, miniatures (paintings), rulers, thrones, baldachins (canopies), borders, calligraphy, floral motif, cushions and flowers.] Apart from "flowers" they both have very diversified paramenters in the subject. In addition to this, I argue that Painitng 1 has more details when compared to painting 2 - if we look in the descriptions and creators sections painting 1 describes that it's been attributed to Govardhan, 17th c., Indian (Artist) and materials used are gold on paper, ink, opaque watercolor, paper, color. 

Painting 2 doesn't have any creator source but the materials mentioned are same as in painting 1. Our next findings brings to Extent, the sizes of both the paintings. This is an intresting area, as we know the paitnings aren't same but the sizes are, so the precise size is 37.2 x 25.4 cm. and 16.5 x 13.9 cm without borders. Hence with all the evidences and findings we can conclude that original one is the paining 1 done in 16th centuary and the painting 2 in the 18th century is one regenrated with more vibrant colours of Shah Jahan Peacock's Throne. 


| Creator | Date | Measurements | Materials/Techniques
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Govardhan,Indian (Artist)| 1634-1635 | 37.3 x 25.2 cm (with borders); 16.5 x 13.9 cm (painting) | gold on paper, ink, opaque watercolor, paper, color
| - | 1800 - 1899 | 37.2 x 25.4 cm |  opaque watercolor, gold, ink, paper

## Conclusion 

Based on the available metadata information, it appears that the Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME) does not currently have much items to discover for the Shah Jahan on the Peacock Throne painting because of multiple duplicates. However, the DLME is a comprehensive digital library of cultural heritage materials from the Middle East and North Africa region, and it is possible that related materials, such as manuscripts, photographs, or other artworks, may be available in the collection.

Metadata is a key component of digital libraries, as it helps users to search, discover, and access materials within the collection. The DLME's metadata is designed to provide detailed information about the materials in the collection, including their provenance, content, and context.

Overall, the DLME is an important resource for preserving and promoting the cultural heritage of the Middle East and North Africa region. While it may not currently have metadata specifically for the Shah Jahan on the Peacock Throne painting, it is a valuable resource for researchers and scholars interested in the history, culture, and languages of the region. The DLME's metadata and search capabilities can help users to explore related materials and conduct research in a variety of fields.
