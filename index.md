Hi, this is Yaakulya. I'm a student at NYU Abu Dhabi majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Interactive Media. My hobbies are reading blogs and playing chess. My skills include programming and bug hunting. I wanted to pursue a career in Cyber Security and work in Bay Area (US). My strengths include team management, and problem-solving. I also love riddles. 

Fun fact:What do you call a group of 8 bits that like to march in unison? 

Answer: A byte of cadence!
