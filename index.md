Hi, this is Yaakulya. I'm a student at NYU Abu Dhabi majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Interactive Media. My hobbies are reading blogs and playing chess. My skills include programming and bug hunting. I wanted to pursue a career in Cyber Security and work in Bay Area (US). My strengths include a positive attitude, team management, and problem-solving. 

Fun fact: I love Marvel, and I believe Tony Stark will return from an alternate universe.
